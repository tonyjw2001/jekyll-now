![_config.yml](/images/enemies-escape.jpg)


Need all the help I can get! Raft and Prison both had a jailbreak and now many criminals are out on the streets of the city. Police be careful with the outbreak of criminals, I'll be around to help with what I can. Civilians please be careful and watch out for any violence on the streets. If anyone finds info on Vulture, Martin Lee, Rhino, Electro, or Scorpion please let me know! [Heres some info on them](http://marvels-spider-man.wikia.com/wiki/Sinister_Six)
